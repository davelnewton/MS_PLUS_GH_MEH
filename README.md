# MS_PLUS_GH_MEH
Repository for people that either (a) don't care that MS is buying GH, or (b) think it'll be fine

## Don't get me wrong

I have legitimate concerns based on MS history--although in fairness, most of the history that *gives* me those concerns is relatively ancient (in computer terms).

## Is this acquisition automatically a bad thing?

Nope. I'm neutral until I actually see action(s) taken that goes against what I think GH is/should be.

MS has recognized, at least to some extent, that OS is an actual thing, and is ultimately good for everyone involved. I don't think MS is blind to the fact that many, *many* developers don't like MS, don't use MS products, and certainly don't *develop* on MS because it's been pretty difficult, historically, to get anything other than MS-based development done on MS-based machines/OSes.

This has been changing recently. Heck I even use VSCode now after being a solid Atom user for some time.

## Haters gonna hate

Yep. And in some cases, with good reason.

But blind hatred and vitriol does everybody a disservice. We're (in theory) rational beings.

Act like it.
